# MODEL_HISTORY

- Purpose: record architectural choices, losses, and evaluation signals for unsupervised training. Append new entries as experiments run.

## Current baseline (placeholder)
- Architecture: TorchScript CNN emitting latent feature map; mask output optional (can be None).
- Losses (planned): contrastive or clustering-friendly objectives (e.g., InfoNCE, DeepCluster-style), plus spatial smoothness/TV regularizers.
- Evaluation signals (planned): clustering stability across crops, feature diversity metrics, optional IoU/accuracy if eval_labels exist.
- Export contract: output tuple `(mask, features)`; `features` consumed by `predict_cnn` latent KNN in [funcs.py](../funcs.py).

## Future entries
- Add dated sections noting: config, loss mix, augmentations, hardware, metrics, and any regressions/improvements.

### 2026-01-15 — Next-gen unsupervised scaffold
- Config: default in `training/config.py` (K randomized in [2,16], soft k-means head, FiLM elevation gate, stride/4 embeddings).
- Loss mix: consistency (symmetric KL), entropy min/max (pixel vs marginal), edge-aware smoothness.
- Data: synthetic paired views with optional elevation + dropout; geometry shared; photometric jitter per view.
- Metrics tracked: cluster utilization, speckle, boundary density, view consistency.
- Notes: eager PyTorch only; refinement lanes (fast box blur, learned conv stub) selectable by knob.
